# About

I am currently working as a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics](https://agsci.colostate.edu/dare/) at Colorado State University. My research topics cover...

My research focuses on understanding the drivers and consequences of household food insecurity (FI), particularly among vulnerable and underrepresented populations. I examine how economic shocks, social safety nets, and household behavior shape food security.

I hold a Ph.D. in Agricultural and Resource Economics from Colorado State University, an M.S. in Labor Economics from Shaanxi Normal University, and a B.A. in Public Management from Henan University of Economics and Law.
