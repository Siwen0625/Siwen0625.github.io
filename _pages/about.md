About
======
I am currently working as a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics]([https://pages.github.com/](https://agsci.colostate.edu/dare/)) at Colorado State University. My research covers topics in applied microeconomics, agricultural/food economics, policy of food and health, labor economics, regional economics, and development economics.

My primary research focuses on the determinants and consequences of health disparities and social inequality among US immigrants relative to their native counterparts.  The overarching theme uniting all her research is to improve the well-being of vulnerable groups through evidence-based analysis of policy impacts on those groups.

I earned my Ph.D. in Agricultural and Resource Economics from Colorado State University, my M.S. in Labor Economics from Shaanxi Normal University and B.A. in Public Management at Henan University of Economics and Law.
