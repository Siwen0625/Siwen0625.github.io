Immigrants can be more vulnerable to economic downturns and, during those periods, more likely to experience food insecurity (FI) than natives. This study examines the effect of the unemployment rate (UR) on the likelihood of being food insecure among diverse groups of immigrant households relative to natives in the U.S. Since unemployment is not randomly determined for households, we create a Bartik instrument by exploiting exogenous spatial variation in industry employment shares interacted with national industry growth rates. Overall, we find a procyclical effect of the UR on household FI. The effect for immigrants is approximately twice as large as compared to natives. Immigrant noncitizens, particularly those from countries with constrained human capital or those who faced adverse economic conditions upon arrival, grapple with heightened FI challenges. The heterogeneity noted across subsamples underscores poverty level and engagement in food assistance programs as potential buffers against FI during economic recessions. Higher education, especially graduate degrees, partially mitigates the impact of unemployment on FI, particularly for US immigrant noncitizens. This analysis sheds light on the differential resilience of groups of immigrants in the U.S. facing economic fluctuations. It further underscores the pressing need to identify and support those at-risk immigrant cohorts that are most vulnerable to short-term economic disruptions.

Since both time and money are essential constraints in food production, immigrant households that face the challenge of insufficient time for food production may have a higher likelihood of experiencing food insecurity, similar to those who are financially disadvantaged. This paper uses a merged dataset covering 16 years (2003-2018) of both food security and time-use surveys to examine how immigrant households use time and money to manage their household FS relative to natives. To overcome the potential measurement errors and endogeneity of household-level time-use and expenditures, aggregated cell-level means of food production time and expenditures are employed as instruments to identify the causal effects of time and money inputs on household FI. Our findings suggest that the marginal returns on time and money inputs vary across different types of households, indicating that household structure matters in managing FI. For single households, more food expenditure is important, while for married households, more time commitment is crucial. Interestingly, more time input significantly improves the likelihood of food security for natives but does not work for immigrants who already spend more time maintaining cultural food preferences and producing food in either single or married households. Meanwhile, more food expenditures help reduce the probability of FI for both natives and immigrants in single households but not in married households. Our findings show an overall message that less time but more money are required for immigrants in household food production to remain food secure.

**Siwen Zhou**, Joshua P. Berning (2024). **[Structural Food Security Dynamics in the United States](https://github.com/Siwen0625/Siwen0625.github.io/blob/master/files/Paper3_Structural_FI.pdf)**

With limited research focused on the dynamics of FS in the US, this paper seeks to explore the long-term structural nature of FS dynamics through household financial asset holdings in the United States. We use a 19-year panel dataset from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (2001-2019) to estimate the Structural Probability of Food Security (SPFS) measure. This metric is estimated by the likelihood that a household's assets will meet or exceed a basic adequacy threshold for at least three months. The SPFS metric enables a nuanced distinction between structural and stochastic dynamics in FS over a long period. Our findings indicate a prevalent stability of FS among U.S. households but highlight that 84% of those facing FI do so due to structural inadequacies in asset holdings, rather than due to unpredictable stochastic events. Notably, households headed by non-white females without a high school diploma suffer most and are caught in structural FI with a pronounced and persistent risk of severe FI.
